# Webscraping_from_job_portal
AS a disclaimer I would like to say that scraping websites can be illegal and websites like facebook, linkedin and monster job portal restrict scraping data from their pages. If we tried to scrape data for educationalor reasearch purpose we can give an API request to the corresponding website authority. So, please make sure, you don't try to change any information from the websites.
Here, I am trying yo Scrape data from indeed job portal for building a job postings in Kerala. Data analytics related jobs from "https://in.indeed.com" using “requests” and “BeautifulSoup” libraries in python to collect and parse data from indeed’s job postings. The data is then store into a dataframe using 'pandas' library and preprocess it for better results.
