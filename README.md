# Webscraping_from_job_portal
AS a disclaimer, scraping websites can be illegal, and websites like Facebook, Linkedin, and monster job portals restrict scraping data from their pages. If we tried to scrape data for educational or research purposes we can give an API request to the corresponding website authority. So, please make sure, you don't try to change any information from the websites.
Here, I am trying to Scrape data from the indeed job portal for building job postings in Kerala. Data analytics-related jobs from "https://in.indeed.com" using “requests” and “BeautifulSoup” libraries in python to collect and parse data from indeed’s job postings. The data is then stored in a data frame using the 'pandas' library and preprocess for better results.
